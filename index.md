## Too Much Data, Too Little Time.

In the age of digitalization every business have thousands of comments and reviews from various platforms. Companies need to have insights from these comments and decide what aspect, product or service to improve.**A business isn't just average of the reviews**. These customer feedback from all over the internet is growing rapidly each day and getting harder and harder to process.

### Power of AI(such a fancy term).

AI is getting integrated in our lives more and more. It will take part in everything from our personal lives to our businesses. How do we know? Let's consider this case:

You're taking feedback from your customers, directly or indirectly, and you need to have insights from these feedbacks in order to take your business one step further. What are you doing good, what are you doing bad, what did you improve over time?

You have two options to process these data. One is hiring people to process the feedback and give a report for you. More and more people will be needed to be hired as data grows eveyday, and it'll take more and more time to process.

Other option is having a program that runs anytime you want. Doesn't care amount of data and gives you instant report. Track improvement of your service/product day-by-day, week-by-week; gives statistics for each of your product/service and do many more just in seconds. Sounds too good to be true right? Not anymore. That's where we're heading to.
